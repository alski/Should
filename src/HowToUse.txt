HOW TO USE:
(From https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/daf5c6db-386b-4994-bdd7-b6cd52f11b72?SRC=VSIDE)

1.Add a new project to your solution by using the installed template

2.Open NuGet.config and add your repositories to the "packageSources" element.
 The script will then publish your package to all the listed repositories.

3.Edit the sample "Package.nuspec" file according to http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/nuspec-reference

4.Add the assemblies you want to add as references in the "lib" folder before building the project
See http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#Package_Conventions

5.Add the files you want to copy to the project folder in the "content" folder before building the project
Remember that you can also do config and file transforms.  http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/configuration-file-and-source-code-transformations

6.Edit one or more of the files in the "tools" folder if you want to run some script on package install, uninstall or init.
See http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#Automatically_Running_PowerShell_Scripts_During_Package_Installation_and_Removal

7.Build the project. 
    1.If in release mode, the packager will try to push your package to the repository using the NuGet API Keys configuration.
        If no valid API key for the specified package source exists, it will prompt you to add it before automatically trying again.
    2.If in debug mode, it will only create the packages.


If there are .pdb files located in the lib folder, a symbols package will automatically be made and published together with the package.
 Please note that when publishing a symbol package, all source files need to be present in the "src" folder, with the same structure as in the actual project.

Make sure all the files you want to include in the package are present in the "lib", "content" and "tools" folders before building the NuGet Packager project.

To publish a new version of your package, bump the version number in the .nuspec file.
